  Cryptographic verification of downloaded files using SHA256, SHA512, SHA1,
  and MD5 checksums. Checksum mismatches are fatal - files are marked failed,
  not silently accepted.

  Implements Constitution Principle IV (Verification & Trust).

    description: |
      As a security-conscious user,
      I want to verify downloaded files against checksums,
      So that I can trust the files are authentic and unmodified.

    acceptance_criteria:
      - "GIVEN checksum via -c flag, WHEN download completes, THEN checksum verified"
      - "GIVEN matching checksum, WHEN verification runs, THEN exit code 0"
      - "GIVEN mismatched checksum, WHEN verification runs, THEN exit code 3"

    definition_of_done:
      - "✅ -c flag accepts checksum in algo:hash format"
      - "✅ SHA256, SHA512, SHA1, MD5 algorithms supported"
      - "✅ Exit code 3 on mismatch"

    title: "Size verification"
    description: |
      As a user,
      I want downloaded file size verified against Content-Length,
      So that I can detect truncated downloads.

    acceptance_criteria:
      - "GIVEN server provides Content-Length, WHEN download completes, THEN size verified"
      - "GIVEN size mismatch, WHEN verification runs, THEN download marked failed"

    definition_of_done:
      - "✅ Content-Length captured from HTTP headers"
      - "✅ Final file size compared to expected"
