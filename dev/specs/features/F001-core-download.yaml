  features build upon.

      As a user,
      I want to download a file from a URL,
      So that I can save files from the internet to my computer.

    acceptance_criteria:
      - "GIVEN a valid URL, WHEN I run safedownload <url>, THEN file downloads to current directory"
      - "GIVEN a URL and -o flag, WHEN I run safedownload <url> -o <path>, THEN file saves to specified path"
      - "GIVEN download completes, WHEN I check exit code, THEN exit code is 0"

    definition_of_done:
      - "✅ curl-based download implemented"
      - "✅ Output path configurable via -o flag"

    title: "Resume interrupted download"
    description: |
      As a user,
      I want interrupted downloads to resume automatically,
      So that I don't lose progress on large files.

    acceptance_criteria:
      - "GIVEN interrupted download with .part file, WHEN I restart, THEN download resumes from last byte"
      - "GIVEN server supports Range requests, WHEN resuming, THEN only remaining bytes downloaded"
      - "GIVEN download completes, WHEN .part file exists, THEN .part is renamed to final filename"

    definition_of_done:
      - "✅ .part file created during download"
      - "✅ Resume position calculated from .part size"
      - "✅ HTTP Range header sent for resume"
      - "✅ .part renamed on completion"
