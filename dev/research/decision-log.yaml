    decision:
      selection: "stdlib net/http with custom wrapper"
      rationale: |
        stdlib net/http provides all primitives needed for resumable downloads
        while maintaining zero external dependencies. This aligns perfectly with
        Constitution Principle II (minimal dependencies). The grab library
        offers excellent patterns to study and inform our wrapper design, but
        its maintenance status (4 years since major update) creates long-term risk.

        Key factors:
        1. Zero dependencies = no external project risk
        2. Full control over resume behavior implementation
        3. Can be optimized specifically for our use case
        4. Go team maintenance ensures long-term stability
      trade_offs_accepted:
        - "Additional 2-3 days development time for wrapper"
        - "Must implement and test resume logic ourselves"
        - "Progress tracking requires custom implementation"
      fallback_plan: "If custom wrapper proves problematic, can adopt grab as a reference and port specific modules"

    implementation:
      effort_estimate: "M"
      blocking_tasks:
        - "Create download manager wrapper with Resume support"
        - "Implement connection pooling configuration"
        - "Write comprehensive tests for Range header handling"
      non_blocking_tasks:
        - "Benchmark against grab for performance validation"
        - "Document API surface for future contributors"

    review:
      reviewers: []
      concerns_raised: []
      concerns_addressed: []

    validation:
      success_criteria:
        - "Resume correctly handles 206 Partial Content responses"
        - "Graceful degradation when Range not supported"
        - "Connection pool efficiently handles concurrent downloads"
        - "Startup time <500ms (performance gate)"
        - "Memory usage within acceptable bounds"
      validation_method: "Integration tests + benchmarks during Sprint 01"
      revisit_trigger: "If implementation takes >5 days or performance benchmarks fail gates"
