# RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
# =============================================================================

objectives:
  primary:
    - goal: "Evaluate HTTP client libraries for resumable downloads"
      description: |
        Compare stdlib net/http with third-party libraries (grab, resty, etc.)
        for implementing resumable downloads with HTTP Range headers.
      success_criteria: "Decision made on library choice with documented rationale"
      status: "not_started"

    - goal: "Understand Range header implementation patterns in Go"
      description: |
        Research how to properly implement HTTP Range requests for download
        resumption, including handling server support detection and partial content.
      success_criteria: "Working code example for resumable downloads"
      status: "not_started"

    - goal: "Design connection pooling strategy for concurrent downloads"
      description: |
        Determine optimal http.Transport configuration for multiple
        simultaneous downloads with proper resource management.
      success_criteria: "Documented pooling strategy with benchmarks"
      status: "not_started"

# =============================================================================
# KEY QUESTIONS
# =============================================================================

key_questions:
  critical:
    - question: "Should we use grab library or build from stdlib net/http?"
      context: |
        Constitution Principle II prefers minimal dependencies.
        However, grab provides battle-tested resumable download functionality.
        Trade-off: simplicity vs maintenance burden.
      answer: null
      confidence: null
      sources: []

    - question: "How do we handle servers that don't support Range requests?"
      context: |
        Not all servers support HTTP Range headers. We need graceful degradation
        to full downloads when partial content is not available.
      answer: null
      confidence: null
      sources: []

  important:
    - question: "What's the performance overhead of external HTTP libraries?"
      context: "Need to ensure any library choice doesn't violate performance gates"
      answer: null
      confidence: null
      sources: []

    - question: "How to handle TLS certificate verification in Go?"
      context: "Constitution requires TLS verification via system CA trust store"
      answer: null
      confidence: null
      sources: []

  exploratory:
    - question: "Can we use HTTP/2 for parallel chunk downloads?"
      context: "Some download accelerators use HTTP/2 multiplexing"
      answer: null
      confidence: null
