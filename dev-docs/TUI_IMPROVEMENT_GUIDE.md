# Research Agent Improvement Plan

## Overview
The goal is to enhance the research agent to work across various projects, ensuring it can adapt to different contexts while maintaining harmony with existing systems like Speckit.

## Key Objectives
1. **Contextual Adaptability**: The agent should be able to understand and adapt to the specific context of any project it is assigned to.
2. **Integration with Existing Frameworks**: Ensure that the agent can work seamlessly with existing tools and frameworks, particularly Speckit.
3. **Documentation and Guidelines**: Create comprehensive documentation that outlines how the agent operates, its capabilities, and how it can be integrated into different projects.

## Steps to Implement
1. **Analyze Current Functionality**: Review the existing capabilities of the research agent and identify areas for improvement.
2. **Define New Features**: Based on the analysis, outline new features that will enhance the agent's adaptability and integration capabilities.
3. **Develop and Test**: Implement the new features and conduct thorough testing to ensure they work as intended across different project contexts.
4. **Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect the new capabilities and provide guidelines for users on how to utilize the improved agent.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the agent based on user experiences and needs.

## Conclusion
By enhancing the research agent's capabilities, we can ensure it becomes a valuable tool for any project, fostering collaboration and efficiency across teams.
